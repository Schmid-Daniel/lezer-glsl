# lezer-glsl

This is a GLSL grammar for the [Lezer](https://lezer.codemirror.net/) parser system.

It was derived from [lezer-parser/cpp](https://github.com/lezer-parser/cpp) and might still contain parts from the cpp grammar,
though I tried my best to remove them. It should also be mentioned that the parser is less restrictive than GLSL, in that it allows
certain combinations of expressions in places it usually would not be allowed, in favor of describing those expressions correctly.

This project is meant to be used together with [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
